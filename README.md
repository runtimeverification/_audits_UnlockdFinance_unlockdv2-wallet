# Rights Delegation Wallet

## Architecture

![DelegationWallet architecture](/docs/architecture.jpg)

## Definitions

**Delegation Wallet:** a set of 3 smart contracts (A Safe smart contract wallet, a DelegationOwner and a DelegationGuard) working together to provide delegation and lock functionalities

**DelegationOwner:** a smart contract that is set as one of the owners of the Safe wallet, it contains the logic related to delegations, locks and using delegated NFTs.

**DelegationGuard:** a smart contract that is set as the guard of the Safe, it contains the logic that freezes the NFT and some Safe configuration

**To freeze a NFT:** to not allow it to be transferred out of the wallet.

**To Delegate a NFT**, is to give permission to a given account to execute some functions or sign off-chain messages like if it were the owner of the NFT until an end date. It freezes the NFT until the pre-established delegation end date, after that date is automatically un-freezed. This is used for use cases like rentals, where we give temporary usage of the asset to an address.

- An NFT can only be delegated by the delegation controller.
- An NFT can only be delegated to 1 address at a time.

**Locking a NFT** freezes the asset until it is unlocked, at any moment, there is no pre-established end date (e.g. the borrower pays back the loan) or claimed after a specified claim date (e.g. the lender claims the collateral asset of a defaulted loan). The Lock only ensures the asset will remain in the wallet/escrow for a time, there’s no delegation.

- The asset is unfrozen ONLY when it is UNLOCKED.
- An NFT can only be locked by the lock controller.
- An NFT can only be claimed by the lock controller if it is locked and it is not delegated or the claimDate is passed.

**To Claim a NFT** is to transfer it out of the safe to a given receiver, it is allowed if the asset is locked and the claim date is passed.

Claim date = loan expiry

## Lock and Delegation Rules

**R#1 -** When delegating a locked NFT, the delegation end date should be LTE the lock claim date.

**R#2 -** When locking a delegated NFT, the lock claim date should be GTE delegation endDate

**R#1 and R#2** ensure that a delegation will always end before or at the lock claim date.
